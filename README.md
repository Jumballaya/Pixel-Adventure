## Progress Report #5

Now making maps with Tiled to allow for easier/quicker map iterations. Also finished the starter level and added the door to the next zone.

Next steps: Still need UX updates for the vendor menu as well as a pause menu. Still need to add more enemies to spawn in.

## Progress Report #3

Vendor NPC now has a shop interface that pauses the game while the player shops for new abilities as well as the 'Ticket Home' option that wins the game for the player.
Right now there is now purchasing mechanic, just the menu and mouseover effects were added.

The next step is adding the purchasing functionality that takes the amount of fruit and gives the new ability to the player. Once purchased, the ability will not be able to be purchased again.
