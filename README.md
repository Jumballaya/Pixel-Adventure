## Progress Report #3

Vendor NPC now has a shop interface that pauses the game while the player shops for new abilities as well as the 'Ticket Home' option that wins the game for the player.
Right now there is now purchasing mechanic, just the menu and mouseover effects were added.

The next step is adding the purchasing functionality that takes the amount of fruit and gives the new ability to the player. Once purchased, the ability will not be able to be purchased again.
